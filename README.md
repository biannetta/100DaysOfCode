# 100DaysOfCode

Repository to keep track of my #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Goal
The overall goal of this challenge is to relearn and gain better understanding of Javascript. 

__The Project__

Plan on building a simple web app made predominantely with vanilla JS and maybe a small library such as [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/)

### Learning Objectives
I've outlined the following learning objectives for this project

- [ ] **Modules** [ES6 Modules](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules) is the newest standard for creating JS Modules
- [ ] **Structure** Defining a proper application file/folder structure that can be portable and reusable
- [ ] **Data Binding** I've always used helpers with data binding, but I would like to get as close to the metal as possible with this and understand whats under the hood
- [ ] **Shadow DOM** Just exactly what hides in the shadows (excuse the pun) of this feature that is being leveraged in every front-end framework


__The App__

The web app will be a data entry tool to replace the current google form I use to keep track of my daily exercise goals. It will allow the user to select the exerices and enter the units completed.

The current google sheet will act as the backend to server up the data for visualzation graphics
